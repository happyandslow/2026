      <a id="submission"><h2>Submission Categories</h2></a>
      <p>Authors can submit a paper in one of the following categories:</p>
          <ul class="topics-list">
              
              <li><b style="color:black">Full Research Papers (12 pages + unlimited references)</b>: describe original research, where novelty is a primary consideration.
                </li>
              <li><b style="color:black">Short Research Papers (6 pages + unlimited references)</b>: Short submissions are reviewed to the same standards as the full research papers and differ primarily in scope. A short paper presents a complete idea that is properly evaluated, just like in a full-length submission.
              </li>
              <li><b style="color:black">Industry Papers (12 pages + unlimited references)</b>: 
              Industry papers describe important industrial advances and application achievements. It encourages work on applying recent research work to real-world problems and industrial systems. Moreover, new applications, systems, challenging real-world use cases, practical customer case studies, as well as analysis of applied technology in an industrial context are highly welcome. We require that at least one of the authors has a non-academic /industry affiliation.
              </li>
              <li><b style="color:black">Vision Papers (6 pages + unlimited references)</b>: 
              Vision papers describe speculative but well-reasoned and thought-provoking ideas, where insight is a primary consideration. Vision papers should present ideas and solutions that differ from prior work and the status quo. A full-fledged system implementation is not required, but empirical evidence and measurements may be helpful in illustrating the feasibility of the proposed vision.
              </li>
          </ul> <br>
      <p>
          All submissions will be judged based on their originality, technical merit, relevance, value to the community, and likelihood of producing interesting discussions at the symposium. Submissions will be kept confidential until accepted. Rejected submissions will be kept confidential permanently.
      </p>

      <p><b>
          At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to attend the conference in order to present the paper.</b>
      </p>

      
      <a id="guidelines"><h2>Submission Guidelines</h2></a>
          <p>Authors must submit original papers <b>that are not being considered for publication in other forums.</b> Submissions cannot be accompanied by nondisclosure, confidentiality, or similar agreements. Further, all submitted papers must cite and clearly differentiate from relevant prior publications, including workshop papers from the same or other authors.</p>

          <p>Papers that violate these requirements will be rejected without reviews. Non-rejected papers will be shepherded, and final acceptance will be conditional on the shepherd’s approval.</p>

          <p>Reviewing for <b>Research (full-length and short) and Vision papers is dual anonymous (i.e., author identities will be kept confidential from reviewers during the review process, and vice versa)</b>. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions, and they should not identify themselves either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). Submissions violating the detailed formatting and anonymization rules will not be considered for review.</p>

          <p>Reviewing for <b>Industry papers is transparent with respect to the company/product, but dual anonymous with respect to the authors</b>. That is, you need not anonymize the company or products/services you are referring to. However, you should not reveal the paper’s author names directly in your submission.</p>


          <p>Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts (e.g., arXiv.org, technical reports, talks, and social media) is permitted. However, <b> your submission must use an anonymized system/project name that is different from any used in such contexts.</b></p>

          <p>If you are uncertain about how to anonymize your submission, please contact the program co-chairs (contact information is at the end of the page) well in advance of the submission deadline.</p>

      <a id="ai"><h2>AI Usage/Authorship Guidelines</h2></a>
      <p>We follow the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship">ACM policy on authorship requirements</a>. Specifically on the use of generative AI tools and technologies, the guidelines note that: "<i>Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc. If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.</i>"</p>

      <p>Please also note the following three authorship concepts that are key to the policy:</p>
      <ul class="topics-list">
        <li>Authors must be the “creator or originator of an idea” and/or Work</li>
        <li>Authors must make a substantial contribution to the Work</li>
        <li>Authors must take full responsibility for all content in the published Work</li>
      </ul>

            
      <a id="formatting"><h2>Formatting Guidelines</h2></a>
      <p><b>Formatting</b>: Research papers must follow the ACM Proceedings Format, using ACM’s LaTeX acmart template or Word: <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>. We require a 9pt font size for paper submission. The LaTeX template should be used as follows: <span style="font-family:BLA;">\documentclass[sigconf, review, anonymous]{acmart}</span>. The margins, inter-column spacing, and line spacing in the templates must be kept unchanged. Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be rejected without review. Judicious use of color is permitted, but the paper should print clearly in black and white.</p>

      <p><b>Paper type</b>: As a subtitle, papers should indicate the submission type (e.g., research, industry, vision).</p>

      <p><b>File type</b>: Each research paper is to be submitted as a single PDF file, formatted for 8.5" x 11" paper and no more than 10 MB in file size. (Larger files will be rejected by the submission site.) Submitted papers must print without difficulty on a variety of printers, using Adobe Acrobat Reader. It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that their submitted PDF file renders correctly.  </p>
            
      <a id="inclusion_guidance"><h2>Guidance on Inclusion</h2></a>
      <p>ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing (SoCC) brings a large scientific and technical community together and has a direct impact on many people from different backgrounds from around the world. Hence, we deeply care about D&I and believe that using inclusive language and examples in paper writing can make a difference. Thus, we strongly encourage authors to follow the <a href="https://dbdni.github.io/pages/inclusivewriting">D&I writing instructions</a> when drafting the paper submissions.

      <!-- Submitters are encouraged to use inclusive language and examples in their papers.  
      This includes using inclusive language in gendered nouns and pronouns (e.g., 
      see <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/gender-inclusive-language/" 
      style="color:red">this article</a> on gender-inclusive language), and inclusive examples 
      when describing people (e.g., see 
      <a href="https://medium.com/@arunis100/inclusive-cs-examples-b5f40e003815" style="color:red">this blog post</a> 
      on inclusive examples). -->
      </p>

      <a id="submit"><h2>Submission Site</h2></a>
      <p>Papers can be submitted here: <a href="https://socc26.hotcrp.com">https://socc26.hotcrp.com</a> </p>
        
            
      <a id="submit"><h2>Authors' Response Period</h2></a>
              <p>ACM SoCC’26 will provide an opportunity for authors of papers that are not early rejected to respond to the reviews prior to the final consideration of the submissions at the program committee meeting according to the schedule detailed above.</p>

      <a id="reverse_reviewer_policy"><h2>Reverse Reviewer Policy</h2></a>
      <p>In anticipation of a potential increase in submissions, we are adopting a “reserve reviewer” policy similar to that which is established by other conferences like OOPSLA and CVPR. For every submitted paper, at least one senior author must register as a reserve reviewer, unless exempt under the criteria outlined below. This information should be included on the submission form, and authors must also register on the TPMS platform. Non-compliance may lead to desk rejection.</p>
      <p>A “senior” author is defined as someone who obtained their PhD five or more years ago. A paper is exempt from the reserve reviewer requirement if:</p>
      <ul class="topics-list">
        <li>There are no senior authors,</li>
        <li>At least one senior author is part of the PC for this conference, or</li>
        <li>All senior authors meet one or more of the following criteria:
          <ul class="topics-list">
            <li>They are new to SoCC and related fields, having published fewer than 3 papers at major conferences (SoCC, SIGMOD, VLDB, SOSP, OSDI),</li>
            <li>They are chairing a major related conference listed above in 2026-2027,</li>
            <li>They have an exceptional circumstance that prevents them from participating in the review process but did not hinder them from writing the paper. This must be verified with the PC Chairs at least three days prior to submission.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>One person may serve as a reserve reviewer for multiple papers. Please provide their information for each applicable paper. </p>

      <p>We hope that the engagement of reserve reviewers will be unnecessary; they will only be called upon as ad hoc reviewers if our submission projections exceed expectations. Should they assist, their review workload will be significantly lighter than that of the Program Committee (PC) members, with assignments tailored to align closely with their expertise.</p>

      <p>However, if a reserve reviewer is deemed "highly irresponsible" (e.g., failing to submit a review without valid justification or using an LLM as a reviewer), the Program Chairs may desk-reject all papers authored by that individual. Co-authors of delinquent reviewers will receive notifications to emphasize accountability and alleviate the burden on organizers.</p>

      <a id="instructions_senior_author"><h2>Instructions for the “senior author”</h2></a>
      <p>The senior author must have a TPMS account linked to the same email address used for the corresponding HotCRP account. If the senior author is new to TPMS, the system will prompt you to upload (or provide links to) 5-10 of your previous papers to assist in the reviewer matching process. The upload process is straightforward, and a step-by-step video is available for guidance. You have the flexibility to choose which papers to upload, as this selection will influence the types of papers you may be asked to review. Aim to include a diverse range of topics that reflect your unique expertise.</p>
